What i did is that i made an app out of a html page using android studio wich can be downloaded here ----> https://developer.android.com/studio/install?hl=en
you can then build an apk based on these files or
you can directly use it by making a directory and placing all the files inside and using the index.html
the html manages the content of the page, the css manages how it looks (color boutton size and all), the js manages mainly how the whole ai works (api key, prompt, ai endpoint)
what i call an ai endpoint is basically who your ai provider is, for me its openrouteur

This is a just a personal project and might get updates :D
